from_differential_to_integral_flux
----------------------------------

from_differential_to_integral_flux(experiment, min_energy, energy_bins,
                fluxes, options)

If user selected differential fluxes, convert to integral fluxes to
caluculate operational threshold crossings (>10 MeV protons exceed 10
pfu, >100 MeV protons exceed 1 pfu).
Assume that the measured fluxes correspond to the center of the energy
bin and use power law interpolation to extrapolate integral fluxes
above user input min_energy.
The intent is to calculate >10 MeV and >100 MeV fluxes, but leaving
flexibility for user to define the minimum energy for the integral flux.
An integral flux will be provided for each timestamp (e.g. every 5 mins).

INPUTS:
experiment (string)
min_energy (float) - bottom energy for integral flux calculation
energy_bins (float 1xn array) - bins for each energy channel
fluxes (float nxm array) - fluxes with time for each energy channel
options (string array) - effective energies for GOES channels

OUTPUTS:
integral_fluxes (float 1xm array) - estimate integral flux for >min_energy
    (Returns all zero values if no energy bins above min_energy)
