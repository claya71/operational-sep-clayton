Description
-----------

Program description for operational_sep_quantities.py VERSION 3.2.

The operational_sep_quantities project needs these files to run:

* operational_sep_quantities.py
* library/read_datasets.py
* library/global_vars.py
* library/derive_background.py
* library/keys.py
* library/ccmc_json_handler.py
* library/model_template.json
* library/observations_template.json

run_multi_sep.py is a code that can run operational_sep_quantities.py automatically for multiple SEP events (i.e. multiple input time periods). The user must input a list of time periods, inputs, and flags in the correct columns in a csv file.

compare_data_model.py plots information derived from operational_sep_quantities on the same plots. This may or may not be kept up-to-date. It was originally written to support the SHINE 2019 SEP model validation challenge. Since then, a complete (separate) validation framework has been/is being developed, so this code is no longer necessary.

    
This program will calculate various useful pieces of operational
information about SEP events from GOES-08, -10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15
data and the SEPEM (RSDv2 and RSDv3) dataset.

SEP event values are always calculated for threshold definitions:

* >10 MeV exceeds 10 pfu
* >100 MeV exceed 1 pfu

The user may add multiple additional thresholds through the command line.
This program will check if data is already present in a 'data' directory. If
not, GOES or EPHIN data will be automatically downloaded from the web. SEPEM
(RSDv2 and RSDv3) data must be downloaded by the user and unzipped inside
the 'data' directory. Because the SEPEM data set is so large (every 5
minutes from 1974 to 2015 for RSDv2 and to 2017 for RSDv3), the program will
break up the data into yearly files for faster reading.

The values calculated here are important for space radiation operations:

* Onset time, i.e. time to cross thresholds
* Onset peak intensity
* Onset peak time
* Maximum intensity
* Time of maximum intensity
* Rise time (onset to peak)
* End time, i.e. fall below 0.85*threshold for 3 points (15 mins for GOES)
* Duration
* Event-integrated fluences
* Proton fluxes at various times after threshold crossing (UMASEP option)

Bad Flux Values and Interpolation
---------------------------------
Data sets are checked for bad data point (negative or None value
fluxes) and the default behavior is to fill in those bad data points by
performing a linear interpolation with time. This choice was made to
calculate more accurate event-intergrated fluence values from data.
Interpolation with time is not appropriate for model predictions, as
it will inherently change the prediction or may not be desired by
the user for the data set. If your model output produces negative flux
values, you may avoid interpolating them by using the --NoInterp flag.

**--NoInterp:** Turn off interpolation with time by
setting the

.. code-block:: console
   
   --NoInterp

flag (or nointerp=True). If the interpolation
is turned off, negative flux values will be set to None.
Zeroes are always treated as valid values and are not replaced.
If there are gaps in the time steps, the code does NOT try to
fill in the gaps. It will ONLY perform interpolation for time
steps present in the input data set. i.e. gaps in time are not
interpolated, only time steps with negative or None flux values.

Units
-----

**UNITS:** User may choose differential proton fluxes (e.g. [MeV s sr cm^2]^-1)
or integral fluxes (e.g. [s sr cm^2]^-1 or pfu). Default units are:
MeV, cm, s, sr
Units are specified in library/global_vars.py.
Note that the code produces fluence by multiplying the flux by time and 4pi steradians.
The program has no internal checks or requirements on units - EXCEPT FOR
THE THRESHOLD DEFINITIONS OF >10, 10 and >100, 1.
If you convert those thresholds in the main program to your units,
you should be able to generate consistent results.
Currently there are no features to change units automatically. SEE MORE
about units in the USER INPUT DATA section below.

Input Options, Background Subtraction, and Tweaks
-------------------------------------------------

**OPTIONS:** User may specify various options, that currently only apply to
GOES data:
Choose corrected or uncorrected GOES fluxes.
Choose to apply Bruno (2017) or Sandberg et al. (2014) effective
energies to GOES uncorrected data (recommend using background subtraction).

.. code-block:: console

   --options uncorrected
   --options uncorrected,S14,Bruno2017 

**BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION:** Users may choose to perform a background
subtraction by specifying:

.. code-block:: console

   --SubtractBG --BGStartDate YYYY-MM-DD --BGEndDate YYYY-MM-DD

The user should look at the data and select an appropriate time frame
prior to the event when the background is calm and well-defined. If
performing background subtraction, the mean background will be subtracted
from the fluxes in the SEP time frame (StartDate to EndDate). Plots
showing the mean background level, the background flux only, and the
background-subtracted SEP fluxes will be created by derive_background to
verify the quality of the background estimation and subtraction.

**--DetectPreviousEvent:** If a previous event is ongoing and the specified time 
period starts with a threshold already crossed, you may try to set the

.. code-block:: console

   --DetectPreviousEvent

flag. If the flux drops below threshold before the
next event starts, the program will identify the second event. This will only 
work if the threshold is already crossed for the very first time in your specified
time period, and if the flux drops below threshold before the next event
starts.

**--TwoPeak:** If the event has an initial increase above threshold for a few 
points, falls below threshold, then continues to increase above threshold again, you
may try to use the

.. code-block:: console

   --TwoPeak
   
feature to capture the full duration of the event. The initial increase above threshold must be less than a day. An example of this scenario can be seen in >100 MeV for 2011-08-04.

**--UMASEP:** A flag was added with the "UMASEP" option. When this flag is used

.. code-block:: console

   --UMASEP

the code finds all information for four energy channels and
thresholds used by UMASEP: >10 MeV, 10 pfu; >100 MeV, 1 pfu; >30 MeV, 1 pfu;
>50 MeV, 1 pfu. The proton flux in each of these channels is reported for
multiple times after threshold crossing (Ts). The applied time delays are
as follows:

* >10 MeV - Ts + 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 hours
* >30 MeV - Ts + 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 hours
* >50 MeV - Ts + 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 hours
* >100 MeV - Ts + 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 hours
    
**--spase_id:** If you know the appropriate spase_id for the your model or
experiment, you may specify it here to be filled in to the json file
for CCMC's SEP Scoreboard with the flag

.. code-block:: console
   
   --spase_id

Event End Time
--------------

**Note about EVENT END TIME:** Currently, the code calculates the end of the
event as the first time that the flux drops below threshold*endfac for
three consecutive points. The endfac variable is specified in
library/global_vars.py.
Mimicking a SRAG code, endfac is set to 0.85 (85% of threshold). This
may be changed in the future to update this to more NOAA SWPC-like logic
to define the end of an SEP event.

Onset Peak
----------

**Note about ONSET PEAK:** In operational_sep_quantities.py version 3.0,
the onset peak may be found up to 12 hours prior to the threshold crossing
that determines the SEP event start time. In previous versions, the onset
peak could only be found at or after the threshold crossing time. For events
that crossed threshold by a small amount, this often meant that the
actual onset peak as identified by eye occurred prior to threshold crossing
at a lower flux value. In an effort to derive the onset peak from the shape
of the flux time profile independent of the applied threshold value, the code
will search for the onset peak 12 hours earlier for events with lower
flux levels. The documentation for
operational_sep_quantities.calculate_onset_peak() has further details.

        bgend_date,nointerp)

Set the desired directory locations for the data and output at the beginning
of the program in datapath and outpath. Defaults are 'data' and 'output'.

Fluence and Time Resolution
---------------------------

**Fluence:** In order to calculate the fluence, the program determines time_resolution
(seconds) by finding the difference between every consecutive set of
time points in the data set. The most common difference is identified as
the time resolution. This method should find an accurate time resolution
even if there are gaps in the time steps.
If the time steps in the data set are truly irregular, the user will
have to manually set the time resolution inside the subroutine
calculate_fluence.

Program Output
--------------

**OUTPUT:** This program outputs different numbers of files depending on the
number of thresholds input by the user and the number of thresholds crossed.
The files contain the fluence spectrum for each threshold, the time profiles
for each energy channel for which a threshold was applied, and event summaries
containing all of the calculated information. 
A file named as e.g. fluence_GOES-13_differential_gt10_2012_3_7.csv contains
the event-integrated fluence for each energy channel using the specified
threshold (gt10) to determine start and stop times.
A file named as e.g. sep_values_GOES-13_differential_2012_3_7.csv contains
start time, peak flux, etc, for each of the defined thresholds.

The program write to file the >10 MeV and >100 MeV time series for the
date range input by the user. If the original data were integral fluxes,
then the output files simply contain the >10 and >100 MeV time series from
the input files. If the original data were differential fluxes, then the
estimated >10 and >100 MeV fluxes are output as time series.
    
The program also writes any time profile to file if a threshold was applied
to it. Each energy channel is written to an independent file, named according
to CCMC's SEP Scoreboard naming conventions. These accompany a json file
that contains all quantities calculated for the SEP event. There is also a csv
file that contains most of the same values recorded in the json file.
    
Example output for values derived from SEPMOD forecasts for the 2021-05-29
SEP event with additional threshold >10, 0.001 pfu, >100, 0.0001 pfu,
>30 MeV, 1 pfu, >50 MeV, 1 pfu, and >60 MeV, 0.079 pfu. Some of the files
below are only created if a threshold was crossed. A default run would produce
only 10 and 100 MeV files, sep_values_*.csv and json file:

.. code-block:: console

   fluence_SEPMOD_RT_60min_integral_gt10_2021_5_29.csv

In the .txt files, the first date is the start date of the time period
specified by the user. The second date is the issue time of the forecast, i.e. the date when operational_sep_quantities.py was run to produce the files.
This second date is only included in the filename when you input your
own user file. The code will assume you are inputting model results. If you
run the code for a native data set (e.g. GOES or SEPEM), the second date
will not be present.

The json and txt files listed above would be the ones that would be appropriate
to read into the CCMC SEP Scoreboard or to pass to the SEP validation code
being developed in conjunction with the SEP Scoreboard. The csv files are legacy
files, but may also be easier for some users to read.
    
Inputting a User Data Set
-------------------------

**USER INPUT DATA SETS:** Users may input their own data set. For example, when performing a validation study, an
SEP modeler could feed their own intensity time series into this
code and calculate all values in exactly the same way they were calculated
for data. Default flux units are
1/[MeV cm^2 s sr] or 1/[cm^2 s sr] and energy channels in MeV for the default
thresholds to be correct. You can specify your units in the
library/global_vars.py file.
    
You can use any units, as long as you are consistent with energy units in
energy channel/bin definition and in fluxes and you MODIFY THE THRESHOLD
VALUES TO REFLECT YOUR UNITS. If you want to use different units, but
still apply the correct operational definitions, you need to modify these
lines in define_thresholds() below:

.. code-block:: python

   energy_thresholds = [10,100] #MeV; flux for particles of > this MeV
   flux_thresholds = [10,1] #pfu; exceed this level of intensity
    
**NOTES:** 

* The first column in your flux file is assumed to be time in format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. IMPORTANT FORMATTING!!
* The flux file may contain header lines that start with a hash #, including blank lines.
* Any bad or missing fluxes must be indicated by a negative value.
* Put your flux file into the "datapath" directory. Filenames will be relative to this path.
* Please use only differential or integral channels. Please do not mix them. You may have one integral channel in the last bin and this must also be the highest energy bin, as this is the way HEPAD works and the code has been written to include that HEPAD >700 MeV bin along with lower differential channels.
*You must specify whether your input file represents model output or observations so that the correct type of JSON file may be written. Use the JSONType flag or json_type variable and specify "model" or "observations" to indicate which is the correct format. The default is set to "model" when run from main.

**USER VARIABLES:** The user must modify the following variables in
library/global_vars.py:

* **user_col:** identify columns in your file containing fluxes to analyze; even if your delimeter is white space, consider the date-time column as one single column. SET IN library/global_vars.py.
* **user_delim:** delimeter between columns, e.g. " " or ","   Use " " for any amount of whitespace. SET IN library/global_vars.py.
* **user_energy_bins:** define your energy bins at the top of the code in the variable user_energy_bins. Follow the format in the subroutine define_energy_bins. SET IN library/global_vars.py.
* **user_fname:** specify the name of the file containing the fluxes through an argument in the command line. --UserFile  The user_fname variable will be updated with that filename. ARGUMENT
* **time_resolution:** the program determines time_resolution (seconds) by finding the difference between every consecutive set of time points in the data set. The most common difference is identified as the time resolution. This method should find an accurate time resolution even if there are gaps in the time steps.. AUTOMATICALLY DETERMINED.
                
Running the code for a user-input file may look like the example below.
Note that the --UserFile location is with respect to the "data" directory
inside the operational-sep directory:

.. code-block:: console

  python3 operational_sep_quantities.py --StartDate 2021-05-29 --EndDate 2021-06-05 --Experiment user --UserFile SEPMOD/Scoreboard/SEPMOD.20210529_000000.20210529_165133.20210529_133005_geo_integral_tseries_timestamped_60min.txt --ModelName SEPMOD_RT_60min --JSONType model --showplot --Threshold "10,0.001;100,0.0001;30,1;50,1;60,0.079" --spase_id "spase://CCMC/SimulationModel/SEPMOD" --FluxType integral
    
Global Variables
----------------

**VALUES SPECIFIED IN library/global_vars.py:**

* **datapath:** directory containing data, 'data'
* **outpath:** directory for program output, 'output'
* **plotpath:** directory for saving plots, 'plots'
* **listpath:** directory for lists (for run_multi_sep.py)
* **badval:** will set any bad data points to this value
* **endfac:** multiplicative factor to define threshold for end of event; threshold*endfac (default 0.85)
* **nsigma:** number of sigma to define SEP versus background flux in background subtraction routine
* **version:** if you are running a model or data set, allows you to enter a version number
* **user_col:** array defining flux columns (0 is always datetime)
* **user_delim:** delimeter used to separate the columns in the time profile file that you will read in
* **user_energy_bins:** energy bins associated with the columns specified in user_col
* **energy_units:** e.g. "MeV'
* **flux_units_integral:** e.g. "pfu"
* **fluence_units_integral:** e.g. "cm^-2" note that the code will multiple flux by time and 4pi steradians
* **flux_units_differential:** e.g. "MeV^-1*cm^-2*s^-1*sr^-1" (CCMC format)
* **fluence_units_differential:** e.g. "MeV^-1*cm^-2" (CCMC format)

(setting the units here will make correct units on plots and in json
file, but doesn't change operational threshold values; must be done
accordingly by hand)
